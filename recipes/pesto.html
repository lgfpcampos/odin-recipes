        </ul>
        <h3> Instructions </h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Basil:</strong> Start by washing and drying the fresh basil leaves. Make sure they are clean and free from any dirt or residue.</li>
            <li><strong>Toast the Pine Nuts:</strong> In a dry skillet over low to medium heat, toast the pine nuts until they turn lightly golden and become fragrant. Stir frequently to prevent them from burning. This should take about 2-3 minutes. Remove them from the heat and let them cool. </li>
            <li><strong>Combine Ingredients:</strong>  In a food processor, combine the toasted pine nuts, garlic cloves, grated Parmesan cheese, and a pinch of salt. Pulse the mixture until the ingredients are finely chopped and well blended. </li>
            <li><strong>Add Basil:</strong>  Add the fresh basil leaves to the food processor. While pulsing, gradually drizzle in the extra virgin olive oil until the mixture reaches your desired consistency. You may need to stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula to ensure everything is well combined. </li>
            <li><strong>Season:</strong>  Taste the pesto and adjust the flavor with more salt and black pepper if needed. Keep in mind that Parmesan cheese is already salty, so be cautious with the additional salt. </li>
            <li><strong>Store or Use:</strong>  Your basil pesto sauce is now ready to be used! You can store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for a few days or freeze it in ice cube trays for longer storage. When using it, consider tossing it with freshly cooked pasta, spreading it on pizza, using it as a dip, or incorporating it into various recipes for a burst of fresh, herbaceous flavor. </li>
