        <h3> Ingredients </h3>

            <li>Fresh Parsley: <em> 1 cup, packed</em></li>
            <li>Fresh Garlic Cloves: <em>3-4 cloves</em></li>
            <li>Red Wine Vinegar: <em> 1/4 cup</em></li>
            <li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil: <em> 1/2 cup</em></li>
            <li>Red Pepper Flakes: <em> 1/2 to 1 teaspoon (adjust to your preferred level of spiciness)</em></li>
            <li>Salt:<em> 1 teaspoon (adjust to taste)</em></li>
            <li>Black Pepper:<em> 1/2 teaspoon (adjust to taste)</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Instructions </h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Parsley:</strong> Wash and thoroughly dry the fresh parsley. Remove the leaves from the stems, as the stems can be bitter. Use the packed leaves for the sauce.</li>
            <li><strong>Mince the Garlic:</strong> Peel and mince the garlic cloves finely. You can use a garlic press or chop them by hand.</li>
            <li><strong>Combine Ingredients:</strong> In a bowl, combine the minced garlic, red wine vinegar, red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper. Mix these ingredients well and allow them to sit for a few minutes to let the flavors meld.</li>
            <li><strong>Add Parsley:</strong> Add the freshly chopped parsley to the mixture. Stir until it's evenly coated with the vinegar and seasoning.</li>
            <li><strong>Add Olive Oil:</strong> Gradually pour in the extra virgin olive oil while continuously stirring the mixture. This will help emulsify the sauce and create a smooth consistency.</li>
            <li><strong>Adjust Seasonings:</strong> Taste the chimichurri sauce and adjust the seasoning, adding more salt, black pepper, or red pepper flakes if desired. You can also adjust the vinegar and oil to your taste preferences.</li>
            <li><strong>Rest and Serve:</strong>  Let the chimichurri sauce sit at room temperature for about 15-30 minutes before serving. This resting time allows the flavors to meld and intensify. </li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Chimichurri sauce is traditionally served as a condiment with grilled meats, particularly steak, but it can also be used as a marinade, drizzle for roasted vegetables, or a dipping sauce for bread. Enjoy the vibrant and tangy flavors!</li>
